This repository is where I save my college work as Google Colab notebooks. I use it to store, organize, and share assignments, experiments, and notes created in Colab.

## Repository structure

- notebooks/ — Google Colab notebooks (.ipynb)
- assets/ — images, datasets, and other supporting files
- README.md — this file

## How to open a notebook in Google Colab

1. Go to the notebook file in this repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Open in Colab" badge if present, or use this URL pattern (replace the path):

   https://colab.research.google.com/github/mondragonStudent/colab-notebooks/blob/main/<path-to-notebook>.ipynb

3. Colab will open the notebook where you can run and edit it.

## Notes

- Keep notebooks small and focused; add datasets to `assets/` when necessary.
- Add a short description at the top of each notebook explaining the purpose and required data files.
