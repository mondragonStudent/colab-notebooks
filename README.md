## About This Repository
This repository contains my college coursework, assignments, and experiments using **Google Colab**. 

Because of restrictions with our student accounts regarding Google Drive access, this repository serves as the central hub for templates and static files, while active development is often handled via **GitHub Gists**.

## Getting Started (Important)
If you are a student setting up your environment for the first time, please read the setup guide included in this repository. It explains how to bypass the Google Drive restriction using GitHub.
